### Problem Statement

**Design and implement a Cyber-Physical System (CPS)** that integrates **wearable smartwatch biometric data**—including ambient temperature, stress levels, and body temperature—with **intelligent control of AC and music systems**.

The system should:
- Automatically monitor **sleep patterns**
- Adaptively optimize **sleep quality**
- Ensure **restorative sleep** through responsive environmental control
